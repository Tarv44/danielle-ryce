        <p>I identified two personas from beharvioral patterns I observed during the interviews.</p>
        <p><b><u>Lindsey</u> & <u>Matt</u></b> are the personification of Kaus’ target audience segments.</p>
        <p>These personas helped guide decision making throughout the design process.</p>
        <p>I expanded on these personas, to gain further insight and understanding, with both <b><u>empathy map</u></b> and <b><u>storyboard</u></b> exercises.</p>

        <p>A successful product is the perfect combination of fulfilling user and business needs, all within the realm of what is technically possible.</p>
        <p>So, I took the actionable insights from the user interviews & competitive analysis, and combined them with requests from the client brief.</p>
        <p>The result is a <b>Feature Roadmap</b>. A document that lists all the features our product needs, from necessary to ideal, for both customer and client satisfaction.</p>

        <p>How will all these features be structured on the website?</p>
        <p>To determine the Informational Architecture, I conducted a card sorting test.</p>
        <p>6 participants organized the same set of cards into categories. Nearly all the cards were sorted into the same categories by each participant, with a small number of irregularities.</p>
        <p>Thanks to these conclusive results, the sitemap was simple to construct.</p>

        <p>I imagined the potential paths a user would take to complete a handful of tasks on the website. This tests the usability and flow of the sitemap to make sure no stone is left unturned.</p>
        <p>I walked through <b>Lindsey & Matt’s</b> entire experience with the website, as seen here in this <b>user flow</b>.</p>
