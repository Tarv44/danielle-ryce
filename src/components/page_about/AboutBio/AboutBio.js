      <p style={{marginTop: 0}}>Born and raised 40-minutes away from New Orleans, it was inevitable that I pursue music. I earned a Bachelor’s in Music Industry and Classical Violin Performance, and launched into a self-made career as a freelance, professional musician for over 6 years.</p>
      <p>I gained ample experience in project and time management as I navigated promotion, event production, booking, networking, and more. When COVID shook the world, I knew I had to gather the very best of my skill set and pivot them into a new career. </p>
      <p>Soon after, I stumbled upon UX and UI design. I distinctly remember thinking, “This is a career?!” It incorporated all the things I loved and excelled at when working with original music bands: graphic design, branding, website creation. Even better, it aligned with my core values: helping and understanding others to create great experiences. </p>
      <p>My friends used to say “little face, big voice” in reference to my singing voice. What a great slogan, right? I think it translates to an even better philosophy. I aim to apply my design skills to “little faces,” i.e. small businesses, nonprofits, creatives, and help them curate their “big voice.” </p>
      <p>But one step at a time...</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I am eager to continue my design education by working with an established team. Let me contribute my enthusiasm for research, excellence in synthesizing results, and engaging execution of ideas to your team! Plus, I’ll throw in my alliteration skills for $0.99. </p>
      <p>I look forward to working together with you as we solve the world’s problems, big and small. Let’s talk! </p>
